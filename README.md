# JavaFIFOQueue

This Java package provides a simple and efficient implementation of a queue data structure operating on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In this queue, the first item inserted is the first item removed, aligning with standard queue operations. This package allows you to enqueue (insert) and dequeue (remove) items from the queue. The implementation can be based on arrays, ArrayLists, or linked lists, according to user preference or specific application requirements
